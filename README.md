Keras Model for Fashion MNIST Dataset

This project involves building and training a neural network using the Keras library to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different fashion categories, such as shirts, trousers, and shoes. The model architecture typically includes layers like convolutional layers for feature extraction and dense layers for classification. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in predicting the correct category of fashion items based on the input images. This project demonstrates fundamental deep learning techniques and model evaluation using Keras.
